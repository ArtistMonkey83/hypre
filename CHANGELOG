Version 1.6.0 released, 2001/07/27.

- The Euclid PILU preconditioning library has been added to the release.
  See Section 7.7.5 of the user manual and Section 6.6.4 of the reference
  manual for details.

Version 1.5.0b released, 2001/07/18.

- New draft of the IJ interface: This new draft is not backward compatible
  with the previous draft.  See the file `docs/V1.5.0b.IJ_transition_info'
  for details on transitioning to the new interface.  See the User's Manual
  and Reference Manual for usage information.

- Added SetRelChange option to GMRES solver.

Version 1.4.0b released, 2001/01/10.

- Changed SStruct interface: The SStructGraphAddEntries routine now
  only sets one graph entry at a time.  See the reference manual for
  details on the new prototype and usage.

- Both PCG and GMRES are available now when using the Struct or SStruct
  matrix classes (only one or the other was previously available).

- First working multiprocessor version of SStruct interface.

- Fixed a bug in PILUT that effected multiprocessor runs.

- Additional interface for Krylov solvers: most function calls are
  available with more generic naming, e.g. HYPRE_PCGSetPrecond
  may be called instead of HYPRE_ParCSRPCGSetPrecond or
  HYPRE_StructPCGSetPrecond.

Version 1.3.1b released, 2000/10/12.

Version 1.3.0b released, 2000/10/11.

- The number of threads to use in an OpenMP run can now be specified via
  either the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable, or by the routine
  omp_set_num_threads().

- Added fortran interface support for compilers that mangle names with
  all capitals (e.g., Cray fortran compilers).  To use, specify the
  '--with-CFLAGS=-DHYPRE_CRAY' option on the 'configure' line.

Version 1.2.0 released, 2000/09/22.

Version 1.1.0 released, 2000/09/07.

- Setup time for PILUT has been dramatically reduced in the case of
  very small drop tolerances, and memory problems that were causing
  coredumps on >2 processors have been fixed.

- Changed Struct interface include file names to be consistent with
  the rest of the library.  They are now:

    HYPRE_struct_mv.h
    HYPRE_struct_ls.h

  The Struct library names have also changed similarly.

- Removed the `stencil' argument from `HYPRE_StructVectorCreate'.

- Added a new interface for semi-structured grids.  This is still very
  much a beta implementation, and should be used with extreme caution
  until further notice.

- The main header files have been restructured to be more readable.
  They will soon include full documentation for their interfaces.

New internal installation: V1.0.0, 2000/07/06

- Now installing both optimized and debugging versions of the library.
  The optimized library is in the usual place; the debugging library
  is in the subdirectory 'debug'.

- Added support for the FEI v1.4, with additional capabilities for handling
  parallel slide surface reduction and general Schur complement reduction. 

- Using a new version numbering scheme.  The C macro HYPRE_Version()
  may be used to retrieve version information.

New internal installation: V2000-05-31

- OpenMP threading added to BoomerAMG.

- Changed ParAMG names to BoomerAMG.  Use 'bin/V2000-05-31.hypre_convert'
  to convert code to use the new names.

- Changed default coarsening type for BoomerAMG.  This version does
  Ruge/Stueben coarsening on the interior of each processor to generate
  an initial independent set for the CLJP coarsening algorithm.

- Various BoomerAMG optimizations.

New internal installation: V2000-03-30

- New AddToValues and AddToBoxValues routines for Struct interface.

- Fairly extensive changes to SMG/PFMG codes to fix setup phase
  scalability problems.  These changes should result in slightly
  slower setup phase times for small-scale problems, but much
  improved setup phase times for very large-scale (greater than
  1000 processors) problems.

- AMG and GMRES solvers have minor fixes for reproducibility under
  restart.

- A subtle coarse grid operator bug in AMG was removed.  AMG no longer
  frees from an uninitialized pointer to an empty domain coarse grid
  operator.

- Minimum iteration count controls have been installed for AMG, GMRES,
  and CGNR.

- Fortran interface wrappers have been made for ParCSRMatrixMatvec and
  ParCSRMatrixMatvecT calls

New internal installation: V2000-01-14
