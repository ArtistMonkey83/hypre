# struct: Run Periodic SMG base 3d case (periodic in x), test parallel 
# and blocking, and run a full periodic case. 
# Note: driver sets up right hand size for full periodic case that 
# satifies compatibility condition, it (the rhs) is dependent on blocking 
# and parallel partitioning. Thus results will differ with number of 
# blocks and processors.
