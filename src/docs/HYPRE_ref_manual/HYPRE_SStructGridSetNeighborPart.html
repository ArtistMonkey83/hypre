Describe how regions just outside of a part relate to other parts.  This is
done a box at a time.<P>Parts <TT>part</tt> and <TT>nbor_part</tt> must be different, except in the case
where only cell-centered data is used.<P>Indexes should increase from <TT>ilower</tt> to <TT>iupper</tt>.  It is not
necessary that indexes increase from <TT>nbor_ilower</tt> to <TT>
nbor_iupper</tt>.  This is to ease the transition from the old <TT>
SetNeighborBox</tt> function, and to provide some flexibility for users.<P>The <TT>index_map</tt> describes the mapping of indexes 0, 1, and 2 on part
<TT>part</tt> to the corresponding indexes on part <TT>nbor_part</tt>.  For
example, triple (1, 2, 0) means that indexes 0, 1, and 2 on part <TT>part</tt>
map to indexes 1, 2, and 0 on part <TT>nbor_part</tt>, respectively.<P>The <TT>index_dir</tt> describes the direction of the mapping in <TT>
index_map</tt>.  For example, triple (1, 1, -1) means that for indexes 0 and 1,
increasing values map to increasing values on <TT>nbor_part</tt>, while for
index 2, decreasing values map to increasing values.<P>NOTE: All parts related to each other via this routine must have an identical
list of variables and variable types.  For example, if part 0 has only two
variables on it, a cell centered variable and a node centered variable, and
we declare part 1 to be a neighbor of part 0, then part 1 must also have only
two variables on it, and they must be of type cell and node.  In addition,
variables associated with FACEs or EDGEs must be grouped together and listed
in X, Y, Z order.  This is to enable the code to correctly associate
variables on one part with variables on its neighbor part when a coordinate
transformation is specified.  For example, an XFACE variable on one part may
correspond to a YFACE variable on a neighbor part under a particular
tranformation, and the code determines this association by assuming that the
variable lists are as noted here.
