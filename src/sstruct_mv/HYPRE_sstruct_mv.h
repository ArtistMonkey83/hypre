 *
 * Variables are referenced relative to an abstract (cell centered) index in the

 * \begin{itemize}
 * \item cell centered variables are aligned with the index;
 * \item node centered variables are aligned with the cell corner
 *       at relative index (1/2, 1/2, 1/2);
 * \item x-face, y-face, and z-face centered variables are aligned
 *       with the faces at relative indexes (1/2, 0, 0), (0, 1/2, 0),
 *       and (0, 0, 1/2), respectively;
 * \item x-edge, y-edge, and z-edge centered variables are aligned
 *       with the edges at relative indexes (0, 1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 0, 1/2),
 *       and (1/2, 1/2, 0), respectively.
 * \end{itemize}
 *

 * \begin{itemize}
 * \item {\tt HYPRE\_SSTRUCT\_VARIABLE\_CELL}

 *
 * NOTE: Although variables are referenced relative to a unique abstract
 * cell-centered index, some variables are associated with multiple grid cells.
 * For example, node centered variables in 3D are associated with 8 cells (away
 * from boundaries).  Although grid cells are distributed uniquely to different
 * processes, variables may be owned by multiple processes because they may be

 * number followed by an offset direction relative to the element's center.  For

 * routine can only be called after \Ref{HYPRE_SStructGridSetVariables}.

 * Describe how regions inside a part are shared with regions in other parts.

 * shared\_iupper}.  This is to maintain consistency with the {\tt
 * SetNeighborPart} function, which is also able to describe shared regions but
 * in a more limited fashion.
 *
 * The {\tt offset} is a triple (in 3D) used to indicate the dimensionality of
 * the shared set of data and its position with respect to the box extents {\tt
 * ilower} and {\tt iupper} on part {\tt part}.  The dimensionality is given by
 * the number of 0's in the triple, and the position is given by plus or minus
 * 1's.  For example: (0, 0, 0) indicates sharing of all data in the given box;
 * (1, 0, 0) indicates sharing of data on the faces in the (1, 0, 0) direction;
 * (1, 0, -1) indicates sharing of data on the edges in the (1, 0, -1)
 * direction; and (1, -1, 1) indicates sharing of data on the nodes in the (1,
 * -1, 1) direction.  To ensure the dimensionality, it is required that for
 * every nonzero entry, the corresponding extents of the box are the same.  For
 * example, if {\tt offset} is (0, 1, 0), then (2, 1, 3) and (10, 1, 15) are

 * and 7 are not the same).
