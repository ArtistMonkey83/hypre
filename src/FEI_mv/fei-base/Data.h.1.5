//This is a very simple class for passing stuff around in

//type safety.

//When you call setTypeName, a char* is created and a copy
//of the input argument is taken. This char* is later destroyed
//by the Data destructor. The void* dataPtr_ member is not
//destroyed, it is just a copy of a pointer.
