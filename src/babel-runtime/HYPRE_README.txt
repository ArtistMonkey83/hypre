The file configure.ac differs from the normal Babel configure.ac: it
has a few changes to support hypre.  Search for "hypre" to see them.

The configure script in this directory will be run by the configure
script in the main hypre directory and should not be run
independently.  That is to ensure that the two configure scripts use
the same compiler settings.

On AIX MP systems, the configure script should be run under nopoe, a
script which forces everything to be run serially on the interactive
(login) node.  Use the provided version of nopoe, which is slightly
different from the system default version on LLNL machines.
Example: "nopoe configure --with-babel" instead of
"configure --with-babel".
Do not abuse nopoe for other purposes, such as production runs.

"make" in the top-leve hypre directory works (It does "make install"
in its subdirectories.)  "make clean" and "make mostlyclean" will
work once hypre is updated to use GNU standard targets.

On frost.llnl.gov, configure cannot find an include necessary for Java
without being told the path, e.g. with the configure argument
 JNI_INCLUDES="-I /usr/java130/include"
That is taken care of in the top-level hypre configure script.
Other systems may need similar additions, depending on where java is.

A future version of Babel should include these four files where needed.

The file configure was generated from configure.ac with autoconf
version 2.54.  Hypre developers may use it as follows:
/usr/casc/babel/apps/autoconf-2.54/bin/autoconf configure.ac > configure

Version 2.52 would work if patched to fix a bug as described below.
I don't know whether the version 2.54 used had a special patch or not.

The following fragment is generated by autoconf and appears in
configure.
# NLS nuisances.

do
  if (set +x; test -n "`(eval $as_var=C; export $as_var) 2>&1`"); then

The last line above is a bug (in autoconf; now fixed in their cvs
repository and the Babel group's version) and should be:
  if (set +x; test -z "`(eval $as_var=C; export $as_var) 2>&1`"); then
