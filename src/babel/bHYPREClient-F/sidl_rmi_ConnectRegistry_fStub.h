 * This singleton class is implemented by Babel's runtime for to
 * allow RMI downcasting of objects.  When we downcast an RMI
 * object, we may be required to create a new derived class object
 * with a connect function.  We store all the connect functions in
 * this table for easy access.
 * 
 * This Class is for Babel internal use only.
