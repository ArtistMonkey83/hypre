C       Symbol "SIDL.DLL" (version 0.8.2)
C       
C       The <code>DLL</code> class encapsulates access to a single
C       dynamically linked library.  DLLs are loaded at run-time using
C       the <code>loadLibrary</code> method and later unloaded using
C       <code>unloadLibrary</code>.  Symbols in a loaded library are
C       resolved to an opaque pointer by method <code>lookupSymbol</code>.
C       Class instances are created by <code>createClass</code>.
C       




C       
C       Create an instance of class SIDL.DLL
C       

        subroutine SIDL_DLL__create_f(retval)
        implicit none
C       out SIDL.DLL retval
        integer*8 retval
        end


C       
C       Cast method for interface and type conversions.
C       

        subroutine SIDL_DLL__cast_f(ref, retval)
        implicit none
C       in opaque ref
        integer*8 ref
C       out SIDL.DLL retval
        integer*8 retval
        end


C       
C       Cast method for interface and class type conversions.
C       

        subroutine SIDL_DLL__cast2_f(self, name, retval)
        implicit none
C       in SIDL.DLL self
        integer*8 self
C       in string name
        character*(*) name
C       out opaque retval
        integer*8 retval
        end


C       
C       <p>
C       Add one to the intrinsic reference count in the underlying object.
C       Object in <code>SIDL</code> have an intrinsic reference count.
C       Objects continue to exist as long as the reference count is
C       positive. Clients should call this method whenever they
C       create another ongoing reference to an object or interface.
C       </p>
C       <p>
C       This does not have a return value because there is no language
C       independent type that can refer to an interface or a
C       class.
C       </p>
C       

        subroutine SIDL_DLL_addRef_f(self)
        implicit none
C       in SIDL.DLL self
        integer*8 self
        end


C       
C       Decrease by one the intrinsic reference count in the underlying
C       object, and delete the object if the reference is non-positive.
C       Objects in <code>SIDL</code> have an intrinsic reference count.
C       Clients should call this method whenever they remove a
C       reference to an object or interface.
C       

        subroutine SIDL_DLL_deleteRef_f(self)
        implicit none
C       in SIDL.DLL self
        integer*8 self
        end


C       
C       Return true if and only if <code>obj</code> refers to the same
C       object as this object.
C       

        subroutine SIDL_DLL_isSame_f(self, iobj, retval)
        implicit none
C       in SIDL.DLL self
        integer*8 self
C       in SIDL.BaseInterface iobj
        integer*8 iobj
C       out bool retval
        logical retval
        end


C       
C       Check whether the object can support the specified interface or
C       class.  If the <code>SIDL</code> type name in <code>name</code>
C       is supported, then a reference to that object is returned with the
C       reference count incremented.  The callee will be responsible for
C       calling <code>deleteRef</code> on the returned object.  If
C       the specified type is not supported, then a null reference is
C       returned.
C       

        subroutine SIDL_DLL_queryInt_f(self, name, retval)
        implicit none
C       in SIDL.DLL self
        integer*8 self
C       in string name
        character*(*) name
C       out SIDL.BaseInterface retval
        integer*8 retval
        end


C       
C       Return whether this object is an instance of the specified type.
C       The string name must be the <code>SIDL</code> type name.  This
C       routine will return <code>true</code> if and only if a cast to
C       the string type name would succeed.
C       

        subroutine SIDL_DLL_isType_f(self, name, retval)
        implicit none
C       in SIDL.DLL self
        integer*8 self
C       in string name
        character*(*) name
C       out bool retval
        logical retval
        end


C       
C       Return the meta-data about the class implementing this interface.
C       

        subroutine SIDL_DLL_getClassInfo_f(self, retval)
        implicit none
C       in SIDL.DLL self
        integer*8 self
C       out SIDL.ClassInfo retval
        integer*8 retval
        end


C       
C       Load a dynamic link library using the specified URI.  The
C       URI may be of the form "main:", "lib:", "file:", "ftp:", or
C       "http:".  A URI that starts with any other protocol string
C       is assumed to be a file name.  The "main:" URI creates a
C       library that allows access to global symbols in the running
C       program's main address space.  The "lib:X" URI converts the
C       library "X" into a platform-specific name (e.g., libX.so) and
C       loads that library.  The "file:" URI opens the DLL from the
C       specified file path.  The "ftp:" and "http:" URIs copy the
C       specified library from the remote site into a local temporary
C       file and open that file.  This method returns true if the
C       DLL was loaded successfully and false otherwise.  Note that
C       the "ftp:" and "http:" protocols are valid only if the W3C
C       WWW library is available.
C       

        subroutine SIDL_DLL_loadLibrary_f(self, uri, retval)
        implicit none
C       in SIDL.DLL self
        integer*8 self
C       in string uri
        character*(*) uri
C       out bool retval
        logical retval
        end


C       
C       Get the library name.  This is the name used to load the
C       library in <code>loadLibrary</code> except that all file names
C       contain the "file:" protocol.
C       

        subroutine SIDL_DLL_getName_f(self, retval)
        implicit none
C       in SIDL.DLL self
        integer*8 self
C       out string retval
        character*(*) retval
        end


C       
C       Unload the dynamic link library.  The library may no longer
C       be used to access symbol names.  When the library is actually
C       unloaded from the memory image depends on details of the operating
C       system.
C       

        subroutine SIDL_DLL_unloadLibrary_f(self)
        implicit none
C       in SIDL.DLL self
        integer*8 self
        end


C       
C       Lookup a symbol from the DLL and return the associated pointer.
C       A null value is returned if the name does not exist.
C       

        subroutine SIDL_DLL_lookupSymbol_f(self, linker_name, retval)
        implicit none
C       in SIDL.DLL self
        integer*8 self
C       in string linker_name
        character*(*) linker_name
C       out opaque retval
        integer*8 retval
        end


C       
C       Create an instance of the SIDL class.  If the class constructor
C       is not defined in this DLL, then return null.
C       

        subroutine SIDL_DLL_createClass_f(self, sidl_name, retval)
        implicit none
C       in SIDL.DLL self
        integer*8 self
C       in string sidl_name
        character*(*) sidl_name
C       out SIDL.BaseClass retval
        integer*8 retval
        end
