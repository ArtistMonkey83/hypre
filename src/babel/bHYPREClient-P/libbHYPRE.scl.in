<!-- note:
 The Babel Users' Manual page "SCL Files for Dynamic Loading" says there should be a
 class element for every one of our classes.  Unless this file is automatically geneated,
 that is unreasonably many classes, and impossible to maintain.
 Fortunately, everything seems to work if you just have a class
 element for the first class which your Python program will try to load.
