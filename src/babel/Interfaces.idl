    * The purpose of a ProblemDefinition is to:
    *
    * \begin{itemize}
    * \item provide a particular view of how to define a problem
    * \item construct and return a {\it problem object}
    * \end{itemize}
    *
    * A {\it problem object} is an intentionally vague term that
    * corresponds to any useful object used to define a problem.
    * Prime examples are:
    * 
    * \begin{itemize}
    * \item a LinearOperator object, i.e., something with a matvec
    * \item a MatrixAccess object, i.e., something with a getrow
    * \item a Vector, i.e., something with a dot, axpy, ...
    * \end{itemize}
    *
    * Note that {\tt Initialize} and {\tt Assemble} are reserved here
    * for defining problem objects through a particular interface.

       * with that object, it must be returned from the problem
       * definition object. {\tt GetObject} performs this function.
       * At compile time, the type of the returned object is unknown.
       * Thus, the returned type is a SIDL.BaseInterface.
